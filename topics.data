Blanket surveillance programs need to end. They were able to start by the patriot act (and if we're being honest even before that). \n\nExecutive overreach is a valid concern, most people aren't aware that our president (executive branch) gets permission from the Judges (judicial branch) with zero oversight from congress. That means there are no proper checks and balances.

Or they don't, and basically shoot themselves in the foot and look like the big government bad guys that the GOP has been trying to paint them as for the past 8 years. \n\nYou see, by changing the argument you use to attack big government it no longer appears to be about hating black people, hating gay people, hating non religious people, etc. it becomes about helping Americans have more privacy, more freedom, and a less powerful president which the people truly want. But the people also want a more productive congress, and sadly, that does mean working together on shit. \n\nThe way I see it, unless the Republican Party changes to look more like a Teddy Roosevelt figure and true statesman, they will die a slow death and drag the rest of the country down with it. \n\nTake a page out of Russia's playbook on the global scale, but do it for freedom instead of oppression and focus on the benefits of all Americans instead of the wealthy few. Infrastructure rebuilding and maintenance would be awesome.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI understand it's a highly unrealistic scenario but it's the best one I could think of that is plausible and would greatly benefit the American people and not the special interests.
