Hillary attacked me personally because I was very happy when her private emails got leaked. The other thing that failed &amp; this was a real monster was her time as Secretary of State. Her job performance as Secretary of State was a total disaster. So, I loved it. I gloat over it. I think it's wonderful because I like to see bad people fail. Hillary failed, I'm happy about it. She's basically a disaster. Well, she said I have very thin skin and you know, coming from Hillary that's pretty low because when you look at her and you see the mind...the mind is weak. I don't see it. I don't get it. I never understood how does she even stay in office? I believe Obama made a terrible mistake putting her on &amp; I think Obama is probably paying a big price. Well if I were running this country, I'd fire Hillary. I mean I'd look her right in that lying, ugly face &amp; say, \"Hillary, you're fired.\" We all lie a little bit, but Hillary is just worse than the rest of us, but it isn't just the lying. Hillary is a very corrupt person. Hillary is a person very lucky to have her husband, and she better be careful or I'll send one of my bimbos over to pick up her husband. Why would he stay with Hillary if he had another choice? She's tried to use CNN and the mainstream media to get even with me, but with me, we fight back. I'll probably jail Hillary because she doesn't tell the truth. As an example, she said she didn't purposefully delete all those e-mails. So probably I'll jail her because it would be fun. I'd like to take some of the corruption out of her fat ass pantsuits. I think they ought to look at her whole life and see where she if coming from because I think she has some very deep seated problems. Perhaps it should be Hillary who should drop out of the race.
